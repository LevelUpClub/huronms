        <h1>My Summer</h1>

        <p>This summer I took a class with <strong>Level Up Club</strong>. We learned HTML <em>and</em> CSS! They even gave me a memory stick to save my work so I could take it home and continue learning. But I <strong>forgot</strong> it at home! Oh no! Thankfully, they made a template for me to work on so I can follow along on day two.</p>

        <h2>Some activities I have done...</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Made an HTML page</li>
            <li>Added CSS to my HTML page</li>
            <li>Had fun!</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
